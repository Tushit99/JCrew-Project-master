Our best-selling and crazy-soft sweaters are the result of over 30 years of expertise, obsessing over fit, durability and handfeel. The result? They're soft and warm, while still being lightweight, which means they're the perfect layer to wear all year round. We're proud to support responsible cashmere production through our partnership with the Aid by Trade Foundation (AbTF), a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agricultural development across the globe. As the foundation's first U.S. member, we source cashmere that is certified to the AbTF's The Good Cashmere Standard®, which ensures the welfare of the cashmere goats, protects natural resources and improves the working conditions of farmers and farmworkers in Inner Mongolia."

'100s' refers to a finer yarn size, and 'two-ply' means two yarns are twisted together to make a single thread. The result is smoother, stronger fabric. We also use our (proprietary) multistep wash process to achieve a soft, broken-in feel from day one. Organic cotton is grown without toxic chemicals or GMOs (genetically modified organisms), which means it's better for the health of the soil, the ecosystem and the people who farm it. Long story short: The customer favorite since 2005 is now better than ever."

Today, the Ludlow comes in two fits and new fabrics from renowned mills every season. We cut this tuxedo jacket in wool from Tollegno 1900 (established 1862 in Biella, Italy), which is one of the country's last mills to still spin its own yarns, a process they've been perfecting for over 150 years.",
